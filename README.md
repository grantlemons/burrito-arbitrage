# Burrito Arbitrage: An analysis of BNPL loan arbitrage and comparable options.

Among my friend group, Buy now, pay later (BNPL) has a poor reputation.
We generally recognize it as a repackaging of consumer debt that is just waiting for you to slip up and miss a payment.

This form of consumer debt has become more and more prevalent in recent years, culminating in Klarna (a major BNPL provider) being offered as a payment option on the food delivery service DoorDash.
The absurdity led a friend of mine to propose an idea he dubbed *Burrito Arbitrage:* making payments you would already have made on, for example, food expenses, via a Buy now, pay later service, and harvesting the difference between the return from investing the money during the payment plan and the zero-percent interest rate.
Through this project, I hope to explore the viability of Burrito Arbitrage, and the returns of said strategy compared to other options such as credit card rewards programs.
